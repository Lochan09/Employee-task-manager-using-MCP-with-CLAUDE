# Employee-task-manager-using-MCP-with-CLAUDE
Employee Task Manager is a lightweight task management system built in Python, designed to help teams track, organize, and monitor work assignments across multiple employees. The system provides a simple yet powerful API for managing tasks, updating their status, and generating reports on team productivity.
Key Features:

Track tasks for multiple employees with unique identifiers
Manage task lifecycle with three status levels: pending, in_progress, and completed
Search and filter tasks by employee, status, or task details
Real-time task updates including status changes and title modifications
Comprehensive reporting with employee summaries and completion metrics
RESTful API design for easy integration with front-end applications
Support for adding and deleting tasks dynamically

Use Cases:

Small to medium-sized development teams tracking sprint tasks
Project managers monitoring individual contributor workloads
Team leads needing visibility into task completion rates
Organizations requiring simple task assignment and tracking

Tech Stack:

Backend: Python
Data Storage: In-memory dummy data (sample employee and task records)

Current Status:
This project currently uses dummy data for demonstration purposes, with five pre-configured employees (emp001-emp005) and their associated tasks. Perfect for testing, prototyping, or as a foundation for building a production-ready task management system.
